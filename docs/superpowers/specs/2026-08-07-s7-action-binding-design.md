# S7 action binding — design v1

Status: **DRAFT — awaiting ratification. No REDs, no code until ratified.**

Origin: the CUDA cutover slice needed a tap that authorizes *this exact
operation*. It discovered that S7 does not bind the action at all. The
owner ruled the substrate be fixed rather than compensated around, which
is right — this is S7's core job, not cutover polish.

---

## The defect

`execution_grant_authorizes_action`
([operator_user_boundary.py:2695](/home/rohit/maez/core/governance/operator_user_boundary.py#L2695))
compares exactly two things:

```python
grant.derived_work_class == derived
and grant.action_params_hash == canonical_hash(params or {})
```

**Neither carries the action.** Reproduced:

| action | derived class | params hash |
|---|---|---|
| `model_routing.cutover_cuda` | `self_modification` | identical |
| `model_routing.wipe_and_replace` | `self_modification` | identical |

So one grant authorizes **every sibling operation of the same class with
the same params**. Nothing in `WorkRequestEnvelope`,
`RenderedRequestStatement`, `S7AuthorizationArtifact`, the durable row,
or `S7ExecutionGrant` records which action was signed.

**What this means in the owner's terms:** a tap for *"switch to CUDA"* is
a tap for *"some self-modification with these arguments."* BAD promises
*exact-request authorization grammar*
([BETA_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md:2780](/home/rohit/maez/docs/governance/BETA_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#L2780));
this does not meet that promise.

## The ruling

**Option 1: versioned, first-class action binding.** Not a new opaque
hash (option 2 — smaller but weaker for *what you see is what you sign*),
and not cutover-only compensation (option 3 — rejected for this
ceremony).

## What the action must traverse

The exact action string travels, end to end, with no inference anywhere:

| carrier | change |
|---|---|
| `WorkRequestEnvelope` | carries `action` (it already receives one; it must **retain** it) |
| rendered signed text | the action is **visible**, not merely hashed |
| `S7AuthorizationArtifact` | new `action` field |
| durable row | new `action` column |
| `S7ExecutionGrant` | new `action` field |
| source-bundle binding | includes the action |
| grant projection | includes the action |

**Visibility is a requirement, not a nicety.** A hash alone cannot
satisfy *what you see is what you sign*: the human tapping the key must
be able to read which operation they are authorizing.

## The edge

```python
grant.action == action
and grant.derived_work_class == derived
and grant.action_params_hash == canonical_hash(params or {})
```

Exact string equality, added to — never replacing — the existing two.

**Binding RED (generic, not cutover-specific):** a grant minted for
`model_routing.cutover_cuda` **refuses** every sibling `model_routing.*`
action with identical params, at the generic S7 execution edge.

## Versioning, explicitly

* the artifact/grant schema **version bumps**; the change is never
  silent;
* `action_params_hash` is **not** reinterpreted — its meaning is
  unchanged, and the action is bound separately;
* historical rows are **never overwritten** and never backfilled.

### Historical artifacts

Verified read-only: the live store holds **four** artifact rows, all
`founder_credential_management`, all expired between 2026-07-08T02:10 and
14:27, three consumed and one unconsumed-but-expired. **No current
authorization needs preserving.**

Rules:

* v1 rows remain **readable and auditable**;
* a missing action is **never inferred or backfilled** — absence is a
  fact about the record, and manufacturing one would be the fabrication
  this project refuses;
* a v1 row **cannot authorize new guarded execution**. It fails closed at
  the edge because it cannot satisfy exact action equality.

*(Note: `ceremony.sqlite3.pre-backfill.bak` exists beside the live store,
so a backfill has happened here before. That is a further reason to state
the no-backfill rule explicitly rather than assume it.)*

## Safety of the build

* build and migration tests run against **store copies**;
* **the live S7 store is untouched** until this slice is separately
  reviewed and authorized;
* no credential is enrolled, disabled, or re-enabled by this work.

## What remains in the cutover afterwards

The cutover-local `cutover_action` params check **stays**, as a second
rail. It is no longer the source of authority — S7 is — and the design
must describe it that way.

## Sequence

1. this design + ADR/BAD amendment (**here**);
2. RED the generic sibling-action bypass at the S7 edge;
3. implement and gate the versioned change across **every** mint and
   consume path;
4. return to cutover 2B and update its receipt projection from the final
   grant shape;
5. complete 2B RED gaps 2–5 before any consumer implementation.

## Carried

* **S1** — does the rendered statement's existing text format have a
  natural place for the action, or does its layout need amending? The
  visibility requirement is settled; where it renders is not.
* **S2** — every existing mint site must pass the action through. I have
  not yet enumerated them, and enumerating rather than assuming is the
  first implementation task.
